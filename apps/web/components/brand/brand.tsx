 * rather than by keying out white globally, because the mark contains white of
 * its own: the square behind the brain, and the gap between its red and green
 * rings. A global key would have punched holes through both.

/**
 * The full lockup, in the variant that suits the surface.
 *
 * The artwork's wordmark is black, so a dark panel needs its own copy rather
 * than the light one on a white plate. A plate is the safe answer and it looks
 * like one: a bright slab in the middle of a near-black sidebar.
 *
 * `bytespate-logo-dark.png` is derived from the light file by inverting only
 * the *achromatic* pixels to the right of the mark. That leaves the red S and
 * the green bar untouched, because they are chromatic, and leaves the mark
 * itself completely alone, because the brain inside it is black on white and a
 * blanket inversion would erase it. The soft grey drop shadow is curved away
 * rather than inverted, which would have haloed every letter.
