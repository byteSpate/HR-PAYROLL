 * Small presentational pieces shared by the page and its sections. They live
 * here rather than in attendance-page.tsx so a section importing them does
 * not create a cycle back to the page that renders it.
 *
 * `TableSkeleton` and `LoadError` used to live here too: three grey bars and
 * a one-line sentence, repeated at four call sites. Both are now PanelTable's
 * job (components/dashboard/record-kit.tsx), which draws a skeleton shaped
 * like the grid it replaces and gives a failed load somewhere to retry from.
