/**
 * Office-timezone helpers for attendance.
 *
 * Attendance juggles three different kinds of time at once, and confusing
 * them is the source of almost every attendance bug:
 *
 *   - `checkIn`/`checkOut` are true instants, stored as UTC.
 *   - `date` is a *label* — which business day a record belongs to.
 *   - `Shift.startTime` is a wall-clock time with no date and no timezone.
 *
 * The business day always comes from `APP_TIMEZONE`, never from the server's
 * locale and never from the client. A server running in UTC at 20:00Z is
 * already tomorrow in Dhaka; one running in US-East reads a 09:15 Dhaka
 * check-in as 23:15 the *previous* day, which would file every ordinary
 * morning arrival under the wrong date. Deriving a date with
 * `new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)` reads it off UTC and is banned in
 * this module — use `officeDateOf`.
