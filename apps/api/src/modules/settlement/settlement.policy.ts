/**
 * The Bangladesh Labour Act's exit numbers, in one file.
 *
 * Mirrors `leave.policy.ts` exactly: the Act's figures appear once, and the
 * service reads a table rather than a chain of conditionals. A correction to
 * the statute is then a change to one file.
 *
 * ⚠️ These figures need verifying against the current amended Act before
 * anyone relies on them. The leave rework already showed why: the November
 * 2025 amendment moved maternity from 112 to 120 days. They are isolated
 * here precisely so a correction stays a one-file change.
 *
 * What this file must NOT do is arbitrate contested cases. Whether a
 * particular dismissal forfeits gratuity is a legal judgement about conduct,
 * not arithmetic. The table encodes the ordinary reading; Finance can
 * override a computed head before approval, audited.
