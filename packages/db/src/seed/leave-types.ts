/**
 * The statutory leave catalogue: Bangladesh Labour Act 2006, as amended.
 *
 * This file is the only place the Act's numbers appear. The seed writes them
 * into `LeaveType` rows and the service reads the rows back — nothing reads
 * these constants at request time, so HR can adjust a quota upward in the
 * database without a redeploy and without this file lying about the statute.
 *
 * Scope note, so the absences here read as decisions rather than oversights:
 *
 * - **Festival holidays (§118)** are not a leave type. Eid, Durga Puja and
 *   the rest are already rows in `Holiday`, and the attendance day grid
 *   resolves them to HOLIDAY for everyone with no application and no balance.
 *   Adding a "Festival" leave type would create a second, spendable copy of
 *   days people already have. The §118 consequence that is genuinely missing
 *   — work a festival holiday, get a substitute day plus two days' wages —
 *   is a payroll rule, and payroll does not exist yet.
 * - **Leave pay (§119)** — the daily average of wages and dearness allowance,
 *   excluding overtime and bonus — is likewise payroll's.
 * - **Weekly holiday (§103)** is 1.5 days per week for shop and commercial
 *   establishments. Leave now has a half-day unit, but §103's half day is a
 *   half day *of weekly off* — a property of the shift calendar, and
 *   `Shift.weeklyOffDays` is an `Int[]` that cannot express half of a
 *   Saturday. Still unrepresented, for that reason and no longer for the
 *   want of a fraction.
